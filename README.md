# fantasy-football-analyzer
A project to track and analyze data related to NFL fantasy football.

Idea inspired by V1 of the project available here: https://github.com/pecjas/FFBStats

David: 

1. Expand current script functionality to work for multiple leagues
2. Move UI components into the browser
3. Allow users to enter league information from the browser
4. Expand analysis to player point stats over time
5. Add flexiblity to use different FFB websites

Jason:
1. Cache data retrieved between sessions. Re-retrieve only when necessary.
2. Generate predictions based on combination of player and other external data
3. Ability to generate "bot" to draft and compete in league.
4. Trigger Trade Suggestion emails to users.
5. "What if" scores - Allow users to see what the score of a matchup would have been if different rules were in place.
